# Supervised pattern recognition 

This repository contains two example implementations of the supervised pattern recognition algorithm and one example for classification using the pattern recognition results.

## Installation
To run the scripts you will need:
1) Python version 3.8.5 and over installed in your machine (during installation make sure you select the Add Python to PATH" checkbox)
2) numpy
3) scikit-learn
4) matplotlib

Link to install [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
Use the package manager [pip](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html) to install packages 2-4.

## Script implementation steps
1) After you have installed items 1-4, create a folder and put the scripts (example_1.py and example_2.py) along with the sample data sets (samples_1.npy, samples_2.npy, labels_1.npy and labels_2.npy) in it.
2) Open up a terminal (for macOS) or powershell (for Windows)
3) Using your terminal [go to](http://modulesunraveled.com/command-line-beginners/moving-and-out-directories-cd-command) the folder you have the scripts and data sets
4) Run the script from your terminal (example for running example_1.py below)

```
python example_1.py
