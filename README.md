# Supervised pattern recognition 

This repository contains two folders; examples and DATA.

## Examples
The examples folder contains implementation scripts for the pattern recognition algorithm along with synthetic data sets.

## DATA
The data folder contains the FIRELAB FL12, FLAME-4 FL12 and BFRS (see manuscript) emission ratios data that were used to run the pattern recognition algorithm and also train the LDA classifier. Note: The FIRELAB FL16 data have been preprocessed as decribed on the manuscript sections 2.2.1 and 3.1.
